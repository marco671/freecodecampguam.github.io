_* this is a WIP document with brief info and notes about our upcoming bootcamp. Pardon the mess._

#### Learn the fundamentals of programming and game development through PyGame. 
Join us as we dive into retro game development! Friendly competition and prizes, engaging curriculum, and team up to make a game!..
Ages 13+ (how do we say that while not alienating older people? Maybe don't mention the age. Or say Ages 13-99)
(Mention somewhere about getting connected to a growing community / movement to bring technology and software development to Guam?)

> Create a curriculum from these

### Schedule Update (Dec 7th)

New Proposed date and times:  
#### February  
2 hour meetups: 6:30pm - 8:30pm

| Mon | Wed | Fri | Focus | 
|---|---|---|---|  
| 6th | 8th | 10th | Mini-Projects. Learning necessary skills | 
| 13th | 15th | 17th | Guided Project. Go through the creation of the final Retro game. Those comfortable are free to work on other their own retro game idea. |  

* these are sequential sessions. Attendance to all is highly recommended.

##### Continuation Plan
As mentioned in the old schedule, after the bootcamp, interested parties will make DIY arcade cabinets to be displayed as a charity art installment. Hopefully that will get them connected with the Bank of Hawaii Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation, Makerspace, and FCCG while doing something visible and helpful for the community.  

##### Continuation in Game development
Besides being able to continue game dev at FCCG, if this bootcamp sparks a lot of interest, we can host the Guam chapter of the Global Game Jam the next year.

### Old Schedule

** Day 1 **  

    Introduce ourselves (Coordinators) and the FCCG. Recognise our sponsors and their contributions to the event.  

    Brief the curriculum.  
    Get them started on the curriculum, making simple text-based games like..  
    * number guessing game
    * rock paper scissors
    * maybe hangman

    Demo some simple games that the coordinators programmed.

>Curriculum?...

** Day 2 **  

    Break up into mandatory teams?

    Have the campers think about what they want to do for the final retro game.

    Tell them we are going to be doing a DIY art installment with all our homemade games for charity.

    Tell them that if they continue after this the bootcamp that this is something they can work towards.

    Show them one of the completed game cabinets.

>Curriculum?...

** Day 3 **

    Field Trip to MakerSpace.

    Introduce them to Tommy and Val + BoHCfE&I

>Curriculum?...

    + List of materails Needed for cabinet and electronic components...
    + What goes where, etc....

* Help from Sponsors  

* Homemade game cabinets 'art' installment for Charity  

    + what charity(s)?
    + where are we setting this up?
    + how long will it stay up?

(https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapters/)

Some topics we should probably be familiar/comfortable with before the bootcamp:

* Object Oriented Programming
* A game loop  
* Making rudimentary physics  
* Time and movement - Velocity
* Interacting with graphics libraries  
* Tranformations  
* Understanding placement and movement in the game world  
* Events? (Async?)
* States? Menus, event screens  
* Event loops and Vectors  

#### Misc ideas

* Go through curriculum and distill it
* have slides about fundamental concepts that we go through with user interation at set points in time?
    * flow of execution
    * variables
    * conditionals (logic?)
    * loops
    * functions
    * objects?
* recommend / force people to group up to make the projects? Maybe even to go through the curriculum?
* choose some set projects that we can recommend, go through how their structure should be beforehand and define sections that could be delegated to people to help with teamwork? Nudge them that direction when they go through it? ... not sounding like such a great idea anymore.
* Pi/parts as prizes at least.
* ask sponsors to donate parts/Pis (old parts or new) to the game cabinets after the bootcamp and in exchange we put their logos and such on the game cabinet they sponsored?
    * have the teams present their game idea and designs to the sponsors and have the sponsors choose "teams"? kinda like a competition between sponsors
